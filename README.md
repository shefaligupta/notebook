Assignment Questions - WDTS
Step 1. Using HTML5/JavaScript (vanilla or framework/library of your choice), create a single page webapp that displays an online notebook. The user should be able to type text into a page that will be saved in local storage (all inputted text should survive a page refresh).
 
Step 2. Add pages to the notebook, no limit. All pages must be saved in local storage as well. User can flip pages of the notebook and either view, or add new text into any of the 5 pages.
 
This webapp should be able to run on a local machine (no internet connection). You can design the notebook in HTML any way you wish, but we will be paying most attention to your code.
